# 📝 Proof OF Concept (POC): SharePoint Vulnerability Detection

This repository contains a step-by-step guide to identify SharePoint installations and validate vulnerabilities. The goal is to automate the process of finding vulnerable SharePoint instances and testing them for potential security issues.

## ⌛ Requirements

- **Tools**:  
  - [Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)  
  - [Httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx)  
  - [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei)  
  - [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)  

---

## 🔍 Steps

### 1. Find Target Subdomains
Use `subfinder` to enumerate subdomains of the target domain. Save the output to a file for further processing.
```bash
subfinder -d target.com -o subdomain_targets.txt
```

### 2. Identify Active SharePoint Instances
Use `httpx` to check for live hosts and store potential SharePoint candidates.
```bash
httpx -l subdomain_targets.txt -o active_sharepoints.txt
```

### 3. Detect SharePoint Technology
Run `nuclei` to confirm if the hosts in the list use SharePoint.
```bash
nuclei -l active_sharepoints.txt -t Exposed-Sharepoint.yaml
```

### 4. Validate Vulnerability
Retrieve the `lists.wsdl` file to check for potential vulnerabilities in SharePoint services.
```bash
wget "https://example.sharepoint.com/_vti_bin/lists.asmx?WSDL" -O lists.wsdl
cat lists.wsdl
```

## 📝 Alternative Methods to Identify SharePoint Sites

### Using Search Engines
- **FOFA**:  
  Query: `header="MicrosoftSharePointTeamServices"`

- **Shodan**:  
  Query: `http.title:"Microsoft SharePoint"`

- **ZoomEye**:  
  Query: `app:"Microsoft-SharePoint"`

## 🔨 How to Fix it :
Here’s a brief summary of how to mitigate the vulnerability of exposed SharePoint sensitive endpoints :

✅ Restrict Access to Sensitive Endpoints :
1. Implement strict access control and role-based authentication (RBAC) to limit who can access endpoints like lists.asmx, sitedata.asmx, etc.
2. Use strong authentication methods (e.g., MFA).

✅ Disable Unused Endpoints:
1. Disable or remove unnecessary endpoints like lists.asmx, usergroup.asmx, etc., if not required.
2. Disable WSDL if not needed to prevent exposing service structure.

✅ Secure Documents and Directories:
1. Apply access controls on document libraries (e.g., /Shared%20Documents/), ensuring only authorized users can view them.
2. Regularly audit document access and modifications.

✅ Patch and Update SharePoint :
1. Keep SharePoint up-to-date with the latest security patches.
2. Follow best configuration practices for securing the SharePoint environment.

✅ Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) :
Implement a WAF to filter and protect SharePoint endpoints from malicious traffic.

✅ Encrypt Data :
Ensure data in transit and at rest is encrypted using HTTPS and proper file encryption.

✅ Monitor and Audit :
1. Regularly audit access logs for suspicious activity.
2. Use monitoring tools like Microsoft Sentinel or Splunk to detect threats.

✅ Server-Level Security :
Secure the network and the IIS server hosting SharePoint, using firewalls, VPNs, and proper server configurations to prevent unauthorized access.

By implementing these steps, you can reduce the exposure of sensitive SharePoint endpoints and improve overall security.
