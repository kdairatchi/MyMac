sudo apt install -y \
    nmap \
    gobuster \
    ffuf \
    subfinder \
    amass \
    sqlmap \
    dirb \
    wget \
    curl \
    python3-pip

# Install Python libraries
pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4

echo "All tools installed successfully!"
```

### **2. Tool Download Script**
This script automates the downloading of additional tools from GitHub repositories.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a directory for tools
mkdir -p ~/bug-bounty-tools
cd ~/bug-bounty-tools

# List of tools to download
declare -a tools=(
    "https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei.git"
    "https://github.com/niklasb/pspy.git"
)

# Clone each tool repository
for tool in "${tools[@]}"; do
    git clone "$tool"
done

echo "All specified tools downloaded successfully!"
```

### **3. Automated Reconnaissance Script**
This script performs automated reconnaissance on a target domain using various tools.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if target domain is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: ./recon.sh <target_domain>"
    exit 1
fi

TARGET=$1

# Create a directory for the target's recon data
mkdir -p ~/bug-bounty-recon/$TARGET
cd ~/bug-bounty-recon/$TARGET

# Subdomain enumeration using Subfinder and Amass
echo "Running subdomain enumeration..."
subfinder -d $TARGET -o subdomains.txt
amass enum -d $TARGET -o amass_subdomains.txt

# Directory brute-forcing with Gobuster
echo "Running directory brute-forcing..."
gobuster dir -u http://$TARGET -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -o gobuster_results.txt

# Nmap scan for open ports
echo "Running Nmap scan..."
nmap -sS -sV -oN nmap_results.txt $TARGET

echo "Reconnaissance completed for $TARGET!"
```

### **4. Running the Automation**
- **Make Scripts Executable**: Before running the scripts, ensure they are executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x install.sh tool_download.sh recon.sh
  ```

- **Execute the Scripts**:
  1. Run the installation script:
     ```bash
     ./install.sh
     ```
  2. Download additional tools:
     ```bash
     ./tool_download.sh
     ```
  3. Perform reconnaissance on a target:
     ```bash
     ./recon.sh example.com
     ```

### **5. Scheduling Automated Scans**
You can use `cron` to schedule regular scans. For example, to run the reconnaissance script every Sunday at midnight:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line:
```bash
0 0 * * Sun /path/to/recon.sh example.com >> /path/to/recon.log 2>&1
```

### **6. Additional Considerations**
- Ensure you have permission to test any target domain.
- Regularly update your scripts and tools to adapt to new vulnerabilities and techniques.
- Consider integrating LLMs or other AI models to enhance your automation further, especially for generating commands or interpreting results.

By following these steps, you can create a robust automation framework that simplifies your bug bounty reconnaissance efforts, allowing you to focus more on analysis and less on repetitive tasks.

- Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage your codebase.

### **4. Develop Individual Agents**
Create scripts for each agent that encapsulate their specific functionalities.

#### Example: Reconnaissance Agent
```python
import subprocess

def recon_agent(domain):
    # Subdomain enumeration using Subfinder
    subdomains = subprocess.run(['subfinder', '-d', domain], capture_output=True)
    return subdomains.stdout.decode().splitlines()
```

#### Example: Vulnerability Scanner
```python
import nmap

def vulnerability_scanner(target):
    nm = nmap.PortScanner()
    nm.scan(target)
    return nm.all_hosts()
```

#### Example: Incident Response Agent
```python
def incident_response(alert):
    # Logic to respond to alerts
    if alert['severity'] == 'high':
        take_action(alert)  # Define take_action based on your incident response plan
```

### **5. Implement Communication Between Agents**
Use a message queue (like RabbitMQ) or a simple REST API to facilitate communication between agents:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/alert', methods=['POST'])
def alert():
    data = request.json
    # Process incoming alert data
    return "Alert processed", 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
```

### **6. Automate Task Execution**
Set up automation scripts that trigger agent actions based on predefined schedules or events.

#### Example Automation Script
```python
import time

def automated_tasks():
    while True:
        # Perform reconnaissance every hour
        recon_results = recon_agent("example.com")
        print("Recon results:", recon_results)

        # Scan for vulnerabilities every two hours
        vuln_results = vulnerability_scanner("example.com")
        print("Vulnerability results:", vuln_results)

        time.sleep(7200)  # Sleep for two hours

automated_tasks()
```

### **7. Schedule Regular Tasks**
Use `cron` jobs or a task scheduler to run your automation scripts at regular intervals.

```bash
crontab -e
```
Add a line to run your script daily at midnight:
```bash
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py >> /path/to/logfile.log 2>&1
```

### **8. Engage with the Community**
Encourage community participation by sharing your findings, tools, and methodologies through platforms like GitHub or forums dedicated to cybersecurity.

### **9. Monitor Performance and Improve**
Regularly review the performance of each agent, gather feedback, and iterate on their functionalities to enhance effectiveness.

### **10. Security Considerations**
Ensure that all agents operate securely, adhering to ethical guidelines in penetration testing and bug bounty programs. Implement logging and monitoring to track agent actions.

### **Conclusion**
By following this cheatsheet, you can build an automated cybersecurity team composed of various AI agents capable of performing essential tasks in bug bounty programs and contributing back to the community. This structured approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also fosters collaboration within the cybersecurity landscape.

Sure! Let’s break down the **Top 10 OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)** vulnerabilities in simple terms, along with a checklist for each. These are the most common security risks for web applications, and understanding them is crucial for protecting your systems.

---

### **1. Broken Access Control**
**What it is:**  
Imagine you have a house with locked doors, but someone finds a way to open them without a key. Broken access control means attackers can access parts of your app they shouldn’t, like admin pages or user data.

**Checklist:**
- Restrict access to sensitive pages (e.g., admin panels) to authorized users only.
- Use role-based access control (e.g., admin, user, guest).
- Test if users can access other users' data by changing IDs in the URL (e.g., `/user?id=123` to `/user?id=124`).
- Ensure APIs enforce proper permissions.

---

### **2. Cryptographic Failures**
**What it is:**  
This is like sending a secret message but writing it in plain text instead of using a code. If your app doesn’t properly encrypt sensitive data (like passwords or credit card numbers), attackers can steal it.

**Checklist:**
- Use strong encryption (e.g., AES-256) for sensitive data.
- Never store passwords in plain text; use hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
- Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to encrypt data in transit.
- Avoid using outdated or weak encryption methods (e.g., MD5, SHA-1).

---

### **3. Injection**
**What it is:**  
Imagine someone slipping a fake note into your mailbox, tricking the postman into doing something bad. Injection attacks (like SQL injection) happen when attackers send malicious code to your app, tricking it into executing unintended commands.

**Checklist:**
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs (e.g., remove special characters).
- Avoid executing user inputs as code (e.g., JavaScript, shell commands).
- Use tools like SQLMap to test for injection vulnerabilities.

---

### **4. Insecure Design**
**What it is:**  
This is like building a house with weak foundations. If your app’s design has security flaws from the start, it’s easier for attackers to exploit.

**Checklist:**
- Perform threat modeling during the design phase.
- Follow secure coding practices and design patterns.
- Use frameworks with built-in security features.
- Regularly review and update your app’s architecture.

---

### **5. Security Misconfiguration**
**What it is:**  
This is like leaving your front door unlocked. If your app or server isn’t configured securely, attackers can easily break in.

**Checklist:**
- Remove default accounts and passwords.
- Disable unnecessary features and services.
- Keep software, libraries, and frameworks up to date.
- Use security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options).

---

### **6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components**
**What it is:**  
This is like using an old, rusty lock that’s easy to pick. If your app uses outdated or vulnerable libraries, attackers can exploit known weaknesses.

**Checklist:**
- Regularly update all dependencies (e.g., libraries, frameworks).
- Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to scan for vulnerabilities.
- Remove unused or unnecessary components.
- Monitor for security advisories related to your software stack.

---

### **7. Identification and Authentication Failures**
**What it is:**  
This is like someone stealing your ID card and pretending to be you. If your app doesn’t properly verify users, attackers can impersonate them.

**Checklist:**
- Enforce strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity).
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Limit failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
- Secure session management (e.g., use secure cookies, expire sessions).

---

### **8. Software and Data Integrity Failures**
**What it is:**  
This is like someone tampering with your mail before it reaches you. If your app doesn’t verify the integrity of data or code, attackers can modify it.

**Checklist:**
- Use digital signatures to verify the authenticity of code and data.
- Validate data integrity (e.g., checksums, hashes).
- Avoid using untrusted third-party libraries or plugins.
- Regularly audit your code and dependencies.

---

### **9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**
**What it is:**  
This is like not having security cameras in your house. If your app doesn’t log and monitor activity, you won’t know when an attack happens.

**Checklist:**
- Log all security-related events (e.g., login attempts, errors).
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity (e.g., multiple failed logins).
- Use tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) for real-time monitoring.
- Regularly review and analyze logs.

---

### **10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
**What it is:**  
This is like tricking your app into making a request to a dangerous place. Attackers can use your app to access internal systems or sensitive data.

**Checklist:**
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs used in URLs.
- Restrict access to internal resources (e.g., firewalls, VPNs).
- Use allowlists for URLs your app can access.
- Test for SSRF by sending requests to internal IPs or domains.

---

### **Summary Checklist for All OWASP Top 10**
1. **Access Control:** Restrict access to sensitive areas.
2. **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data and use HTTPS.
3. **Injection:** Validate and sanitize inputs.
4. **Design:** Follow secure design principles.
5. **Configuration:** Secure server and app settings.
6. **Components:** Keep software and libraries updated.
7. **Authentication:** Use strong passwords and MFA.
8. **Integrity:** Verify data and code integrity.
9. **Logging:** Monitor and log security events.
10. **SSRF:** Validate URLs and restrict internal access.

---
